# Overview

This AI Resume Tailor is a web app to help you customize your resume for any job description using artificial intelligence. Users upload their resume and paste a job posting, and the AI analyzes both to generate a tailored resume that highlights relevant skills and experience. I made this software is to reduce the time and effort to apply for jobs and to learn ways to implement AI in my programs.
